#Robots Improved (For Becker's Robots)
An improvement upon the regular Robot object class from the Becker.jar library(Becker's Robots).

##Disclaimer
This was made for a programming logic course at Sheridan College. Take it with a grain of salt, it could set your house on fire for all I know.

##Tools used
- [Becker.jar](http://www.learningwithrobots.com/index.html)
- [IntelliJ IDEA 2016.2.5](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

##Future for this project
- Just small little bug fixes here and there

##How to use
1. Clone this repo
2. Load up your favourite Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, NetBeans, (Hopefully not Dr.Java..))
3. Import the becker.jar dependency (Not needed if you're using IntelliJ and you're using my included IntelliJ project file)
4. Build and then run
5. Edit the TestRobotImproved.java to make the robot do as you wish!
